Former American President Jimmy Carter is braving a savage Israeli campaign in the United States and the rest of the Western countries because he dared to speak out and break the barrier of silence , by comparing the Hebrew state to the white racist regime of South Africa and exposing the violations by its governments of the rights of the Palestinians .
President Carter faced a series of accusations beginning with anti-Semitism and ending with spreading lies , while he is the man who won the Nobel Peace Prize , and achieved for Israel the greatest strategic accomplishment in its short history , which is the signing of the Camp David Accords that split Arab ranks and got Egypt out of the confrontation , and established the first diplomatic relations between Israel and the largest Arab State .
President Carter 's book , which is on the best - seller book list , came as a shock to the Jewish lobby and a breach of its domination in the American media and political institutions , at a time when the whole world is paying an exorbitant price for the wars of the neo-conservatives , Israel 's supporters , in Iraq , Afghanistan , and soon in Iran .
And perhaps some might argue that President Carter did not speak as forcefully and dare to confront the Jewish lobby until after he left power , and is nearing the last stages of his senior age , which is true .
But the man did not last in power more than one term -LRB- four years -RRB- , and when he began to understand the truth of the conflict in the region , he lost the presidential elections .
President Carter sided with his conscience as a human being , and he decided to speak his mind strongly and sharply against a racist state which hijacked , through its supporters , the White House and the decision - making circle in it , and exploited it to serve its interests and its wars , and to cover for its crimes against the Palestinian people and the entire Arab nation .

Sandoz AG , a major Swiss chemical and pharmaceutical group , said that its group sales rose 25 % to 9.482 billion francs -LRB- $ 5.80 billion -RRB- in the first nine months of this year , with strong gains in all divisions .
A year earlier sales totaled 7.567 billion francs .
Positive currency rates and strong sales growth led to a substantial rise in consolidated profit in the period , although the company did n't provide figures , as is customary with Swiss companies .
Sandoz said it expects a `` substantial increase '' in consolidated profit for the full year , barring major currency rate changes .

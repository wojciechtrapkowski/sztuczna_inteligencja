The situation is much more pessimistic and tense half a world away , in the Middle East .
Matthew Chance is in Jerusalem with the latest .
Those peace moves may be gathering pace in Washington , but talk here on the ground in Israel in the Palestinian - controlled territories is of further conflict .
A number of funerals have been taking place over the course of today following a day of clashes on Friday , the first of those after a Palestinian teenager was shot and killed in a confrontation near Hebron with the Israeli security forces .
Another Palestinian man was also killed near Hebron yesterday .
We are told he was shot dead by a Jewish settler .
Israeli security forces say he tried to stab the settler before he was killed .
All this following a suicide bomb attack on a roadside cafe near the West Bank settlement of Mehola , which , of course , yesterday , left three Israeli soldiers injured .
More than 340 people , mostly Palestinians , have been killed in the latest round of confrontation over the past 12 weeks between Israelis and Palestinians .
As I say that violence is continuing on a day - to - day basis creating a very uncertain , very gloomy backdrop for these Washington talks to go ahead .
Again , that was Matthew Chance reporting from Jerusalem .

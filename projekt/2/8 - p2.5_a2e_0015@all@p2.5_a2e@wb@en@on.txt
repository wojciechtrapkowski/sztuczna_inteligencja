Indian newspapers published a human tragedy and a moral scandal of the temporary tourist marriage called " Mutaa " , which some Arab Shiites in India have been practicing for years .
They go to India every year .
They are elderly and they have money , and they marry poor , young Muslim girls .
After a month , the husband flees and returns to his country , abandoning wife and children , particularly if the wife is pregnant .
He even gives them false information about his address , so that he can run away from responsibility for the children .
One of these people continued to marry every year , for more than twenty years .
The last time he married a girl that turned out to be his daughter from his first tourist marriage in India .
The problem turned into a tragedy and a scandal for Muslims and Arabs in the Indian media .
This kind of spurious marriage , which takes advantage of girls ' poverty , caused awful human tragedies .
Many children produced by this marriage live without any identity , nationality or support .
Some countries imposed strict rules to protect girls from this type of injustice , by imposing harsh restrictions on marriage to foreigners .

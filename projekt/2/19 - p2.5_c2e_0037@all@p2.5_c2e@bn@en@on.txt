Early in the morning , Kuomintang candidate Hao Lung - bin was also accompanied by Party Chairman Ma Ying - Jeou , canvassing on the streets of Taipei where the votes of the Green Camp were concentrated .
At voters ' request , Ma Ying - Jeou danced a cha - cha , bringing the atmosphere to an exciting climax .
Though leading in the polls , Hao Lung - bin still needs to be prudent , and will hold a major campaign event on the eve of the elections .
KMT Honorary Chairman Lien Chan will also attend to show his support .
The KMT has exerted its utmost effort to win the battle for Taipei mayor .
However , Kaohsiung is the major battlefield between the blue and the green camps .
In the next few days , the KMT will place all its focus on Kaohsiung .
Party chairman Ma Ying - Jeou has campaigned frequently in the South , and on Election Day he will also accompany candidate Huang Chun - ying to cast his vote there before he returns to Taipei .
Two days prior to the election , Chen Shui - bian and the leaders of the DPP will also divide into a few groups to accompany candidate Chen Chu and conduct a blanket canvass for votes in Kaohsiung , and focus on winning the votes .
The election battles for the mayors of Taipei and Kaohsiung are entering a white - hot sprinting stage , as candidates from both the blue and the green camps are exerting an all - out effort .
However , whatever the final result is , analysts pointed out that voters ' either high or low turnout rate on the 9th and the proportion trend of undecided voters will all be the important decisive factors .

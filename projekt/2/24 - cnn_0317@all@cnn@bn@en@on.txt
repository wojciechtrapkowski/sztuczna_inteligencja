As Bob pointed out , the next battleground is a bill to block lawsuits by victims of gun violence or families against gunmakers and dealers , and one person whose suit would be blocked is Denise Johnson if the legislation goes through , the widow of bus driver Conrad Johnson , the last person killed in the Washington , D.C. sniper attacks .
Jonathan Lowe is an attorney with the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence who filed the suit on behalf of Johnson and other victims ' families .

''
